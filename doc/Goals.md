## Principles

Goals are designed with the following principles:

1. Descriptive goal names: Goals should have short, descriptive names and preferably a single word verb. Their effect should be clear to those familiar with the background simulation in Elite Dangerous.
2. Few, useful goals over many, niche goals: Goals should be broadly applicable. Niche goals should be handled manually.
